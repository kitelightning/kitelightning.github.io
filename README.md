## Kite & Lightning's Open Source UE4 Repo

We're a small 4-team VR indie studio working on a immortal baby party brawler, **[Bebylon Battle Royale: http://bebylon.world](http://bebylon.world)**

We're big on sharing so we decided to pull all our various open-sourced UE4 features/plugins into this repo. Everything here is permissively licensed so feel free to use in your own games.
